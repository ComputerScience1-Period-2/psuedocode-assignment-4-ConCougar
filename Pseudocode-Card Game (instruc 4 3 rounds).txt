for number of rounds equals 1 and players simultaneously place the first card from the top of their deck down with the card facing upwards and number of rounds is less than 3:
	if player 1's card has a greater value than player 2's card:
		player 1 receives both cards that were played in that round and adds them to the bottom of their deck
	else if player 2's card has a greater value than player 1's card:
		player 2 receives both cards that were played in that round and adds them to the bottom of their deck
	else player 1's card and player 2's card have the same value: 
		both players enter "war" where both place down one card facedown then another card faceup  
		if player 1's 2nd faceup card is greater than player 2's 2nd faceup card:
			player 1 receives all the cards played during that round adds them to the bottom of their deck
		else if player 2's second faceup card is greater than player 1's 2nd faceup card:
			player 2 receives all the cards played during that round adds them to the bottom of their deck
		else player 1's card and player 2's second face up card have the same value: 
			both players enter another "war" where both place down one card facedown then another card faceup in 
				while player 1's card and player 2's face up cards after "war" continue to have the same value:
					both players enter "war" where both place down one card facedown then another card faceup 
				if player 1's 2nd faceup card is greater than player 2's 2nd faceup card:
					player 1 receives all the cards played during that round adds them to the bottom of their deck
				else if player 2's second faceup card is greater than player 1's 2nd faceup card:
					player 2 receives all the cards played during that round adds them to the bottom of their deck
