war requires a standard deck of 52 card
a deck of cards is evenly divided among 2 players
players keep their cards in their deck facedown
the players simultaneously take the card from the top of their deck down facing upwards
each card has a value: Ace=14, King=13, Queen=12, Jack=11, 10=10, 9=9, 8=8, 7=7, 6=6, 5=5, 4=4, 3=3, and 2=2
the player with the higher card value receives the cards played in that round
if the players encounter a situation where they place down cards with the same value: they enter "war" and both place down one card face down then another one face up
continue "war" if the players continue to put down cards face up with the same value
the player with the higher faceup card value in the "war" receives all the cards played in that round
the game ends when one player has all of the cards in the deck
